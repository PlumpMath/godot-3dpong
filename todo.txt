
- the position where the ball hits the paddle should influence the reflection angle. (use an anchor, like in that one godot breakout example by heartbeast. will will then be able to change the influence the paddle has over the ball by moving the empty object closer or further away.)

- add side-view cameras (make a mockup first?)


- write down feature list/plan.

- implement an imperfect paddle AI


- use delta time in _process and _fixed_process.

- should the reimplementation of all collision code still be done? or will it work fine as-is? (we already move the Paddle via set_translation now. so the wall-collisions aren't a problem anymore.)

???- try reimplementing all collision code... handle paddle-collisions manually (or maybe all collisions?)
	- the Ball will be a RigidBody in Character mode, because we need get_colliding_bodies() and set_linear_velocity() (like in HeartBeast's Breakout tutorial.) (will that cause an acceleration bug, like in the tutorial? the one that happens when you hit the ball with the side of the paddle, when the ball is very slow. it will then accelerate a lot...)
	or use kinematic mode? will get_colliding_bodies() still work, then?
	- Walls will be kept as StaticBodies
	- Paddle will be a KinematicBody, but it will be moved with set_pos() so the paddle will be unstoppable by the ball.
