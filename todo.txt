- turn all meshes around (in blend file, and re-export), so the front is actually the front...
- fix everything related to that rotation

- mouse cursor is not hidden when captured.
- no way to exit game when mouse is captured. add global quit hotkey (alt+F4? escape?)

- use delta time in _process and _fixed_process.

- write down feature list/plan.

- use a child object "inputHandler" for handling input? implement a method "InputHandler.GetMovement" for querying movement. (maybe implement AI like this, too.)
