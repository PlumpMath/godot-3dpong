
- implement the different InputHandler scripts (see doc/planned_features.txt)

- implement menus. (see doc/planned_features.txt)

- make breakout scene & multiple stage subscenes.

- make sound effects and add them. (how does sound work in godot? look at platformer demo)
	- we will need sound effects for the following things:
	
	paddle_hit1 (lower pitched, for paddle 1)
	paddle_hit2 (higher pitched, for paddle 2)
	wall_hit
	block_hit (for breakout mode) (maybe multiple ones, depending on block color?)

- limit maximum angle of the ball to prevent it from taking a long time to reach the other side of the playing field.


- implement an imperfect paddle AI


- probably won't do this because it will be unnecessary after implementing the maximum angle limit:
- add 2 switchable physics modes for the ball (after implementing breakout, won't need to do double the scripting work that way):
	- "Realistic Mode": which does proper reflection calculations when the ball hits something (currently implemented as default.)
	
	- "Pong Mode": which ignores proper physics and simply handles all the axis' separately. (i.e.: collision on X axis -> velocity.X gets negated.)
